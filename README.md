# Meteor Strike Map
A map of the earth showing all known meteor strikes throughout history. Limited data on each meteor is available by hovering over any of the strikes.

This is a project for the FreeCodeCamp Data Visualisation Certificate. FreeCodeCamp.com is an open source and welcoming community of people learning to code. Great for those who have never touched HTML through to intermediate programmers. Check it out.

> Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/mVEJag.
>
> - User Story: I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
> - User Story: I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
> - User Story: I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
> - Based on the [dataset provided by FreeCodeCamp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json)
